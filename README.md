**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A browser remake of the original Gwent minigame from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.<br/>Click [here](https://romain-durban.github.io/gwent-classic-v4.0/) to play.

Unlike v3.0 remake, this one is a much deeper redesign, addressing further balance issues. Number of cards is drastically reduced and abilities have been tweaked (and made more complex).
This is based on the huge work from [Novigrad Tavern](https://www.ebay.com/usr/novigrad_tavern), this remake is an attempt to implement the cards they have designed (there are some minor differences though).
